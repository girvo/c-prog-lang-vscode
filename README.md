# The C Programming Language

This is my workbook as I work through the above book (Second Edition), using Visual Studio Code on macOS to do so. Open this folder in `vscode`, open the file you wish to run, and execute the `make and run` task with the file open. It will build the file, then execute the binary in one go via the `.vscode/tasks.json` config.
